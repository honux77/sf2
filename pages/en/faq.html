                    <PRE>
Question: After leaving the bird kingdom (Bedoe), a bird-like creature (Peter) is following me, but I don't know where to go.
Answer: You need to talk to the village elder. Talk to him two or three times, not just once.

Question: I took the blind man (Krazit) on the boat and killed the Kraken. What now?
Answer: Go to the Ancient Ruins in the eastern desert and talk to the old man (Kazim). Make him follow you.
Then go to the ruins located just below the village where you got the archer May. He will open it for you.
After the old man leaves, obtain the Wooden Panel.

Answer: Go straight up from the pond where you rescued Elric. He will open the path for you. Enter the cave to head towards Creed's Mansion.

Approach it, press the A button, and select SEARCH.

Question: How do I use the Force Sword on the Devil's Head?
Answer: Stand in front of it, press the A button, and select SEARCH.

Question: When is the best time to promote characters? How do I use promotion items?
Answer: Promoting at level 40 gives the best stats, but it's very hard to reach.
Promoting at 40 can also make the game too easy. For a balanced experience, we recommend promoting around level 20.
To use special promotion items, just have the character carry it, and the priest will ask if you want to use it during promotion.

Question: Why can't Lemon equip any weapons?
Answer: This is a bug in the English ROM/emulation. (Editor use is not covered here.)

Answer: Both are only obtainable in the Japanese version.

Question: How do I get the Light of Hope and Life Ring?
Answer: They are only available in the Japanese version.

Question: Why can't I use the Taros Sword or Camilla's Iron Ball?
Answer: Because they are exclusive to those bosses.

Question: Please recommend some good characters.
Answer: All characters can be good if raised well, but personally...
Bowie, Karna, Sarah, Sheela, Slade, Gerhalt, May, one of the Pegasus Knights, Baron, Randolf, Tyrin, Peter, Rohde.
