                    <h1>Gameplay</h1>
                    <PRE>
Shining Force is a Tactical RPG (SRPG). 
Unlike traditional RPGs such as Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy, the core difference lies in the combat system. Instead of simply taking turns attacking, you move your characters strategically across a battlefield, much like chess. Victory depends on where you place your characters and what actions they take.

However, unlike most SRPGs that focus only on combat, Shining Force retains the charm of traditional RPGs. Outside of battle, you explore towns and the world map, talk to NPCs, find items, and follow a rich storyline.

Most commands in Shining Force use an intuitive icon-based menu system, making it easy to understand even without knowing the language. While Shining Force 1 used this menu for everything (including talking and searching), Shining Force II introduced a simplified system where the C button automatically handles talking and searching. Note: Be careful, as some specific spots still require manually selecting the "Search" command from the A-button menu.

<B>Controls</B>

D-Pad: Move characters and navigate menus.
A Button: Open the menu and use items.
B Button: Cancel or return to the previous menu.
C Button: Talk to people or interact with objects.

<B>Starting the Game</B>

Press Start at the title screen to meet the Witch and begin your adventure.

Witch: "Hehahaha... you've finally come! Oh, you look confused. Don't you remember why you're here? I've cast a spell on you! You can't escape this strange forest unless you help me."

"What would you like to do?"

(Choosing Start)
Witch: "What shall I call you?"
(Choose a name or press End to default to Bowie.)

Witch: "Bowie... a fine name! Now, choose your difficulty."

Norm (Normal): "You want it easy, eh?"
Hard (Hard): "Hmm, a wise choice."
Super (Super): "How brave of you!"
Ouch (Impossible): "What? Do you have a death wish?"

(After selection)
Witch: "Good luck! There's no time to waste!"

<B>The Church</B>

The Church is essential for saving your progress, reviving fallen allies, curing ailments, and promoting your characters.

Priest: "Welcome! Tell me your wish."

       RAISE
 CURE         PROMO.
       SAVE

RAISE: Revives fallen party members.
CURE: Cures poison or removes curses.
SAVE: Record your progress.
PROMO. (Promotion): Promote characters level 20 or higher to a new class.

<B>Promotion</B>
Promotion is a turning point for your characters. It becomes available between levels 20 and 40. Promoting transforms your character into a more powerful class, allowing them to equip better weapons and learn new spells. Regardless of the level at which you promote, the character resets to Level 1 in the new class. Promoting at Level 40 makes you much stronger, but it's very time-consuming and can make the game too easy. We recommend promoting at Level 20 for a balanced experience.

<B>The Caravan</B>
<img src="file/pic/rohde.gif"><img src="file/pic/astral.gif">

Mid-game, you will obtain the Caravan, which serves as your mobile base. Since you can only take 12 heroes into battle, the rest will wait in the Caravan.

       JOIN
 DEPOT        ITEM
       PURGE

JOIN: Add a hero from the Caravan to your active battle party.
DEPOT: Manage items stored in the Caravan.
ITEM: Manage items held by your active party.
PURGE: Move a hero from your party back to the Caravan.

<B>Stats</B>

Attack (ATT): Strength of your attack. Damage is roughly ATT - Enemy DEF.
Defense (DEF): Your resilience to physical attacks.
Agility (AGI): Determines the order of turns in battle. Higher agility means moving sooner.
Movement (MOV): Number of spaces a character can move. Influenced by terrain.
Level (LV): Character's current experience level.
Hit Points (HP): Your life force. You die if this reaches 0.
Magic Points (MP): Resources for casting spells.
Experience (EXP): Gained through actions in battle. Reach 100 to level up.

<B>Combat</B>

Battles are turn-based. When it's a character's turn, they can move and then take an action.

       ATTACK
 MAGIC           ITEM
         STAY

ATTACK: Strike an enemy within range.
MAGIC: Cast a spell.
ITEM: Use an item from your inventory.
STAY: End the character's turn without acting.

<B>Terrain Effects (LAND EFFECT)</B>
1. Movement: 0% tiles allow full movement, while 30% tiles (like mountains or forests) slow you down. Flying characters ignore terrain effects.
2. Defense: Rough terrain (30%) provides a defensive bonus, reducing incoming damage.

Winning a battle usually requires defeating the enemy boss. If you retreat using the Egress spell, you keep your status and experience but must restart the battle.
