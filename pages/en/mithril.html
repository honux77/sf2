During your journey, you will find small, grey stones. These are Mithril pieces.
There are a total of 15 Mithril pieces in the game.
These can be used in the late game to craft powerful weapons for your party members.
While cursed weapons might have higher attack power, they often drain health or cause paralysis, making Mithril weapons the most reliable elite equipment in the game.

<B>How to Use Mithril</B><br>
First, you need the Dry Stone, found near the furnace in the Dwarven Cave near the Fairy Woods.

Late in the game, after defeating the Red Baron, find a shallow stream to the north. Use the Dry Stone (A-button -> Item -> Use) to reveal the secret entrance to the Dwarven Village.

Inside the village, find the blacksmith's workshop located up the stairs in the back.

<B>Crafting Advice</B><br>
Crafting costs 5,000 gold per item. The weapon produced is random. 
Save your game before ordering, and if you don't get the desired weapon, reload and try again.
The probability of getting the "best" weapon in a category is typically around 4%.
