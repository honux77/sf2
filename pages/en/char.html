                    Spells: Egress (1), Bolt (22 31 42 51)<br>
                    Description: The protagonist of Shining Force II. Though he appears younger than other heroes, his
                    skill is unmatched. His attack power grows rapidly with training. Bolt (Spark) becomes a powerful
                    asset later on, though his MP pool is limited. He can equip all swords and the White Ring, giving
                    him high defense. If Bowie falls in battle, the party retreats, forcing a restart of the battle.

                    Spells: Heal (1 7 22 40), Detox (4 13 33 45), Blast (10 16 25 36), Slow (19 29)<br>
                    Description: Joins early alongside Chester. She is the primary healer for the first half of the
                    game. Using Heal regularly, even when not strictly necessary, helps her gain experience quickly.
                    Promoting her to Master Monk turns her into a powerhouse, combining combat prowess with recovery
                    spells. While Karna's Aura or Sheila's Boost might be more flashy, Sarah is a reliable combat medic.

                    Joins: At the School<br>
                    Description: Your first Centaur unit. He has excellent mobility and balanced stats. Using the
                    Pegasus Wing to promote him to Pegasus Knight grants him flight, making him incredibly versatile.
                    Without flight, his mobility suffers in forests and deserts. He is strong early on but may feel
                    average in the late game.

                    Description: Boasts high attack and defense but suffers from very low agility and movement.
                    Promoting him to Baron using 'Warrior's Pride' increases his mobility and allows him to use swords,
                    making him much more reliable.

                    Blaze spells lose effectiveness late game. Promoting him to Sorcerer with the 'Secret Book' gives
                    him access to powerful summon magic.

                    in the game after level 15 and promotion. As a Ninja, his stats skyrocket, and he learns utility
                    magic. He is the only character who can wield the Gisarme.

                    his low damage output remains a challenge.

                    Her attack power grows significantly in the late game. A must-have character if you need ranged
                    support, though she shares the mobility weaknesses of other Centaurs.
