                        Whew~ I've finally finished it! It took almost 3 weeks of hard work. ㅡ,.ㅡ<br>
                        I even lost my working files three times during the process, which was incredibly frustrating,
                        but I'm so happy to have finally completed it! Hehe.<br><BR>
                        First and foremost, a huge thank you to <b>Moogie</b> from <A
                            href="http://www.shiningforcecentral.com/">Shining Force Central</A> for allowing me to use
                        the weapon/item/map icons and for letting me adapt the HTML format from their site. Her
                        walkthrough was also an invaluable resource for this project.<br><BR>
                        I'd also like to thank <b>Landius</b> for explaining the nuances between 'Onushi' and 'Kisama'
                        in the Japanese version of Shining Force 2, and the members of ManiaZone for their
                        insights.<br><BR>
                        Special thanks to all the members of the <b>SEGA Fan Club</b> (지존세가) who inspired me to write
                        this guide. In particular, I'm grateful to Megamix, Samdol, Raining, Moonori, Segamen, and
                        Castoasis! for their advice and interest.<br><br>
                        I also want to thank my friends at <b>Jumesyn</b> for their support, and Century for the advice
                        on walkthrough structures.<br><BR>
                        To the many friends at <b>ManiaZone</b>—C-Man, NC, ArtBaesung, SuddenDeath, TerrySung, Munyeom,
                        and others—thank you for answering all my questions.<br><BR>
                        Finally, to everyone reading this: this is my first walkthrough, so it might be a bit awkward to
                        read.<br><BR>
                        However, if it has been helpful to you, that's more than enough for me. Thank you!<br><Br>
                        Sincerely,<br>
                        <b>Kofu</b> (코푸)
                    </p>
